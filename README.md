# Hi there.
### Do you write mods in Stardew Valley?
### Do you hate JSON with ***Passion***?
### Would you rather handle everything in C# Because it is objectively better at creating and handling custom behavior than injecting data from multiple individual json files?

# Well boy are you in luck!

This library for Stardew Valley modders aims to simplify the bare essentials needed for simple tasks rather than manually handle and inject content into the game.
